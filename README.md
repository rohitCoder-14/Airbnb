Project Overview:

This project showcases a fully responsive Airbnb Clone Website built to replicate the core functionality and design of the popular online rental platform Airbnb. The application allows users to browse, search, and book vacation stays while property owners can list and manage their accommodations seamlessly. It demonstrates front-end development, backend integration, and database connectivity to deliver a complete full-stack web application experience.

Key Features:

  1. Property Listings: Users can view detailed property information, including price, location, photos, and amenities.
  
  2. Advanced Search & Filters: Search by city, date, price range, and number of guests.

  3. User Authentication: Secure login/signup system with session or token-based authentication.

  4. Booking System: Interactive booking flow with availability checks and dynamic pricing.

  5. Database Integration: All property and booking details stored in a structured database (e.g., MySQL / MongoDB).

  6. Responsive Design: Mobile-friendly interface optimized for all screen sizes.

  7. Admin Panel (optional): Manage users, properties, and bookings through a dedicated dashboard.

Project Objectives:

To develop a full-stack web application that mimics the core functionality of Airbnb, focusing on user experience, dynamic content rendering, and database management.
The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in modern web development technologies, including frontend design, backend logic, and API/database integration, while delivering an interactive and scalable rental platform prototype.
